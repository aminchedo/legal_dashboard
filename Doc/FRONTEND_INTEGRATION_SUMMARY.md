## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Module Features
```javascript
// Event broadcasting across pages
dashboardCore.broadcast('documentUploaded', { fileId, fileName });

// Cross-page event listening
dashboardCore.listen('documentUploaded', (data) => {
    refreshDocumentList();
    updateDashboardStats();
});

// localStorage synchronization
dashboardCore.storeEvent(eventName, data);
```
